# Simple full stack project that is a re-do of my Quote Keeper app since I am not going to update/maintain it on Expo. 

This is the new and better front end of my Nucamp Honors project and it utilizes React. 

The backend repo is https://github.com/lilyruth/newQuoteKeeperServer.

The deployed project is at https://quotekeeper.io. 

Users can:
-View quotes without registering
-Register (will receive a confirmation email) 
-Save quotes
-View a paginated list of saved quotes
-View individual quotes and pick from various backgrounds for that quote
-Tweet individual quotes
-Email individual quotes
-Delete individual quotes
-Add their own quotes
-View a random quote from their saved list
-Request a password reset (They receive an email with a temporary password that is hashed in the db and then deleted when a new password is set)
-Reset their password
-Delete their account
